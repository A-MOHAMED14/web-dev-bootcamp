CSS POSITIONING


Static Position:
This is the default positioning for all elements.
Elements with static positioning are positioned in the normal flow of the document.
They're not affected by the top, right, bottom, or left properties.


Relative Position:
Relative positioning moves an element relative to its normal position.
When you use relative positioning, you can use top, right, bottom, and left properties to offset the element from its normal position.
Other elements on the page still treat the element as if it were in its original position, so there may be space left for it.


Absolute Position:
Absolute positioning removes the element from the normal document flow.
It positions the element relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if one exists; otherwise, it positions it relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport).
Absolute positioned elements are not affected by other elements, and they can overlap other elements.
If there's no positioned ancestor, the element will be positioned relative to the document.


Fixed Position:
Fixed positioning is similar to absolute positioning but positions the element relative to the viewport (the browser window).
Elements with fixed positioning stay in the same place even when the page is scrolled.
They're often used for elements like headers or navigation bars that you want to stay visible as the user scrolls down the page.


In summary:

Static: Normal document flow, no special positioning.
Relative: Moves an element relative to its normal position.
Absolute: Removes the element from the normal flow and positions it relative to its closest positioned ancestor or the document.
Fixed: Positions the element relative to the viewport, so it stays in the same place even when
