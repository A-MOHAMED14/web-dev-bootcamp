# Lighthouse Audit

Make note of the performance metrics and PWA optimizations generated by the Lighthouse report. It's important to remember that metrics can vary greatly between operating systems, so don't worry if your results are different from your peers or instructor.

## Performance Metrics

Click on "Expand View" to get more information about the metrics. Make note of the metrics and their values below (the first one is done for you):

### First Contentful Paint: 0.2s

- First Contentful Paint marks the time at which the first text or image is painted.

### Total Blocking Time: 0 ms

- Sum of all time periods between FCP and Time to Interactive, when task length exceeded 50ms, expressed in milliseconds.

### Speed Index: 1.0s

- Speed Index shows how quickly the contents of a page are visibly populated.

### Largest Contentful Paint: 0.3s

- Largest Contentful Paint marks the time at which the largest text or image is painted.

### Cumulative Layout Shift: 0.494

- Cumulative layout shift measures the movement of visible elements within the viewport.

## PWA optimizations

Scroll down the audit report until you see the `PWA` section that lists the PWA optimizations. Make note of the various aspects of a PWA below (the first one is done for you):

- Registers a service worker that controls page and `start_url`

* Registers a service worker that controls page and `start_url`

* Configured for a custom splash screen

* Sets a theme color for the address bar

* Content is sized correctly for the viewport

* Has a `<meta name="viewport"> tag with `width`or`initial-scale`

* Does not provide a valid `apple-touch-icon`

* Manifest doesn't have a maskable icon
